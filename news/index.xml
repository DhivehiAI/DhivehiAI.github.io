This launch is aligned with 14th April, a day marked as &amp;ldquo;Dhivehi Language Day&amp;rdquo; in Maldives.
The primary mission of dhivehi.ai, is open access to various tools, technologies and knowledge around Dhivehi. Our hope is that in doing so, we will be able to remove hurdles and accelerate the growth of these technologies.
