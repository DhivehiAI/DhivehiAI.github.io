We're happy and delighted to officially announce the launch of dhivehi.ai!
This launch is aligned with 14th April, a day marked as "Dhivehi Language Day"
in Maldives.

The primary mission of dhivehi.ai, is open access to various tools, technologies and knowledge
around Dhivehi. Our hope is that in doing so, we will be able to remove hurdles
and accelerate the growth of these technologies.

dhivehi.ai is an community project, and as such, relies on your continued support
and participation!

with us through any of the channels in [About Us](/about/).
