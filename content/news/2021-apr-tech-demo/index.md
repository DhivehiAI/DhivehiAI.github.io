As a demonstrator for the current state of various technologies,
we put together a simple digital-assistant that can respond
to simple commands.

The assistant is able to tell you the time, read the news and so forth,
and additional, transcribe speech into a document on the fly.

This is accomplished with a combination of STT and TTS tech.

Check out the video for the full demo!
