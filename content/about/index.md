DhivehiAI is a group of developers, engineers, researchers and academics focused on supporting technology around the Dhivehi language.

We officially kicked off on 14th April, 2021 - a date celebrated as “Dhivehi Language Day” in the Maldives.

Our key goal is sharing knowledge and experience with the community, and in doing so, hopefully serve to accelerate growth.
